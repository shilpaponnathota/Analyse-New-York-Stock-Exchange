## Analyse-New-York-Stock-Exchange
In this project I analyzed the real life data from the New York Stock Exchange and drew a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies and created a smaller subset of the data.
There are three tasks: 1) complete data analysis and create a presentation to share the findings, 2) develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, and 3) create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
